statistics information.  Run time statistics show much processing time has
been allocated to each task since the application booted. */

/* In this port, the time base for the run time stats is generated by a 64 bit timer.
 * FreeRTOS requires a 32 bit counter to get track of the statistics. This counter should be at least 10 times faster than
 * configTICK_RATE_HZ (the RTOS Tick)
 * In this implementation, the value of the 64 bit wtimer is divided by 1024 and casted to 32 bits in order
 * to compute the statistics. Thus the counter speed is CPU_CLOCK/1024, which is still much faster than  configTICK_RATE_HZ
 *
 * "cycles" printed in the statistics are cycles of this counter ticks (each corresponding to 1024 CPU clock cycles).
